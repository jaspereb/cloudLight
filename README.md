# cloudLight

## Note: This is code for the pi based one which worked but was never properly stable and remains unfinished. See the other branch for the much better arduino code. 

This project is a raspberry pi based lamp in the shape of a cloud. 

It uses a BRG LED strip along with the Pi Zero W and OpenWeatherMap to change color and light based on the weather forecast. The pyowm library and rpi_ws281x library form the core of the functionality.
